% runTransfection1 runs the structural identifiability analysis for the 
% model for mRNA transfection described by
% 
%    Leonhardt et al. (2013). Single-cell mRNA transfection studies:
%    delivery, kinetics and statistics by numbers, Nanomedicine: 
%    Nanotechnology, Biology and Medicine, 10(4), 679-688.
%
% All parameters are considered individually, resulting in a
% non-identifiability of the translation rate and the initial mRNA
% concentration.

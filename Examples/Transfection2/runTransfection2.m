% 
%    Leonhardt et al. (2013). Single-cell mRNA transfection studies:
%    delivery, kinetics and statistics by numbers, Nanomedicine: 
%    Nanotechnology, Biology and Medicine, 10(4), 679-688.
%
% The translation rate and the initial mRNA concentration are combined,
% to ensure structural identifability.

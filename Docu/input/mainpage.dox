 @section intro Introduction
 
 GenSSI is a Matlab implementation of generating series for structural identifiability as defined in

 - Chiş, O.-T., Banga, J.R. and Balsa-Canto, E. (2011) Structural Identifiability of Systems Biology Models: A Critical Comparison of Methods, PLoS ONE, 6, e27755.

 - Chiş, O., Banga, J.R. and Balsa-Canto, E. (2011) GenSSI: a software toolbox for structural identifiability analysis of biological models, Bioinformatics, 27, 2610-2611.

 With GenSSI, the user can specify differential equation models in terms of symbolic variables in Matlab and then analyze the models to determine which parameters are globally or locally identifiable. In addition, there are some utilities for converting models to polynomial form, or to or from AMICI format.

 @subsection git Obtaining GenSSI via the Git versioning system
 In order to always stay up to date with the latest GenSSI versions, simply pull it from our Git repository and
 recompile it when a new release is available. For more information about Git checkout their <a href="http://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">website</a>
 
 The Git repository can currently be found at https://github.com/thomassligon/GenSSI and a direct clone is possible via
 @code git clone https://github.com/thomassligon/GenSSI.git GenSSI @endcode

 @section install Installation
 
 If GenSSI was downloaded as a zip, it needs to be unpacked in a convenient directory. If GenSSI was obtained via cloning of the git repository, no further unpacking is necessary.

 Models are generally stored in
 @code GenSSI/Examples @endcode
 but GenSSI should be able to find them in any directory that is is the Matlab path.

 When a model is analyzed GenSSI stores the results in
 @code GenSSI/Results @endcode
 
 To use GenSSI, start Matlab and add the GenSSI direcory to the Matlab path. To add all toolbox directories to the Matlab path, execute the Matlab script
 @code genssiStartup.m @endcode
 To store the installation for further Matlab session, the path can be saved via
 @code savepath @endcode

 @page code Code Organization
 
 In the following we will briefly outline how the GenSSI code is organized. For a more detailed description we refer the reader to the documentation of the individual functions.

 @section directory Directory Structure

 The main, or root, directory, which we refer to as GenSSI, contains most of the GenSSI functions. In addition, the following subdirectories are used:

 - GenSSI/Auxiliary contains some auxiliary functions, such as genssiRemoveZeroRows.
 - GenSSI/Examples contains model definitions.
 - GenSSI/Results contains the results of analysis.
 - GenSSI/Docu contains tools for creating the GenSSI documentation, as well as input and output of that process.
 - GenSSI/Docu/config contains configuration files for the documentation tools.
 - GenSSI/Docu/input contains input for document creation, including .dox files.
 - GenSSI/Docu/output contains

 @section document Document Creation

 New versions of the documentation are created with the help of:

 - MatlabDocMaker.m (in GenSSI/Docu)
 - mtoc++ (needs to be installed and available via the path variable)
 - Doxygen (needs to be installed and available via the path variable)
 - LaTex (needs to be installed and available via the path variable)
 - Graphviz (needs to be installed and available via the path variable)
 - Gostscript (needs to be installed and available via the path variable)

 The documentation configuration is changed by editing the files in the GenSSI/Docu/config directory and by running

 @code MatlabDocMaker.setup @endcode

 A new version of the documentation is created by calling

 @code MatlabDocMaker.create('latex',true) @endcode

 This results in an html version of the guide (index.html and many other files in GenSSI/Docu/output), and a pdf version (refman.pdf in GenSSI/Docu/output/latex).

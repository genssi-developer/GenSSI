In the following we will briefly outline how the Gen\+S\+SI code is organized. For a more detailed description we refer the reader to the documentation of the individual functions.\hypertarget{code_directory}{}\subsection{Directory Structure}\label{code_directory}
The main, or root, directory, which we refer to as Gen\+S\+SI, contains most of the Gen\+S\+SI functions. In addition, the following subdirectories are used\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Gen\+S\+S\+I/\+Auxiliary contains some auxiliary functions, such as genssi\+Remove\+Zero\+Rows.
\item Gen\+S\+S\+I/\+Examples contains model definitions.
\item Gen\+S\+S\+I/\+Results contains the results of analysis.
\item Gen\+S\+S\+I/\+Docu contains tools for creating the Gen\+S\+SI documentation, as well as input and output of that process.
\item Gen\+S\+S\+I/\+Docu/config contains configuration files for the documentation tools.
\item Gen\+S\+S\+I/\+Docu/input contains input for document creation, including .dox files.
\item Gen\+S\+S\+I/\+Docu/output contains
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{code_document}{}\subsection{Document Creation}\label{code_document}
New versions of the documentation are created with the help of\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Matlab\+Doc\+Maker.\+m (in Gen\+S\+S\+I/\+Docu)
\item mtoc++ (needs to be installed and available via the path variable)
\item Doxygen (needs to be installed and available via the path variable)
\item La\+Tex (needs to be installed and available via the path variable)
\item Graphviz (needs to be installed and available via the path variable)
\item Gostscript (needs to be installed and available via the path variable)
\end{DoxyItemize}

The documentation configuration is changed by editing the files in the Gen\+S\+S\+I/\+Docu/config directory and by running


\begin{DoxyCode}
MatlabDocMaker.setup 
\end{DoxyCode}


A new version of the documentation is created by calling


\begin{DoxyCode}
MatlabDocMaker.create(\textcolor{stringliteral}{'latex'},\textcolor{keyword}{true}) 
\end{DoxyCode}


This results in an html version of the guide (index.\+html and many other files in Gen\+S\+S\+I/\+Docu/output), and a pdf version (refman.\+pdf in Gen\+S\+S\+I/\+Docu/output/latex).
